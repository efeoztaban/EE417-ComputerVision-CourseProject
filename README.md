This repository contains the term project for the EE417: Computer Vision course, focusing on building an automated system to detect traffic rule violations using computer vision techniques. The project tackles common traffic violations, including speed limit exceedance, wrong-way driving, breakdown lane usage, and slow left-lane driving, aiming to enhance urban traffic control.

The solution employs image processing and computer vision algorithms to analyze video footage of a multi-lane road. It uses methods like line detection (HoughLines) to identify lane boundaries, blob analysis for moving object detection, and speed estimation based on time and distance calculations between designated checkpoints. MATLAB's ForegroundDetector tool is used to separate moving vehicles from the background, facilitating violation detection and reporting. The system effectively identifies different types of violations and flags them with visual warnings and snapshots. The report discusses the implementation process, results, and potential improvements, emphasizing the scalability of computer vision in traffic management.
